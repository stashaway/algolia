Question 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking." 

Cheers,
George

Answer:
Hello George!

Thanks for reaching out. I'd be happy to help you with those and any other questions you might have. 

Records and Indexing are at the heart of search operations, so lets get them cleared up right away.

First, records- Records are simply any item you'd like to search for. A record can contain any amount of information you need. Records are formatted in JSON. One record might look like this:

{\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "George Foreman",\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"occupation": "Boxer",\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"interests": "Grilling"\
}\

That brings us to Indexing.

In order for Algolia to work, we need to take all of your data (your records) and restructure them in a special way. This process is called Indexing. In simpler terms, it's just you providing the data that you want to be searchable so we can use it.

I hope this answers your questions.

Have a great day!\

Question 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

Answer:
Hello Matt!

Let me know what time works for you.\
